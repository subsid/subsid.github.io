<h1 class="title">Physics of Flocking</h1>
<p>
I implemented a <a href="https://subsid.github.io/flocking/dist/">flocking simulation</a> using <a href="https://threejs.org/">threejs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Flocking (or Swarming) is a nice example of something known as <b>emergent behavior</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence">wiki</a>).
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This behavior is common among various animal groups such as birds, ants, bees, fishes. Here is a nice video of starlings flocking around.
</p>

</div>

<p>
The idea was popularized in the field of graphics by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Reynolds_(computer_graphics)">Craig Reynolds</a>, when he created the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a> artificial life simulation in 1986.
</p>

<p>
At its core, each Boid (Bird-oid object!) follows three simple rules:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>Seperation</b></b> Avoid crowding local buddies.</li>
<li><b><b>Alignment</b></b> Direction of velocity should be along the average direction of local buddies.</li>
<li><b><b>Cohesion</b></b> Stay centered between local buddies.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And that's it! This leads to some cool emergent behavior. This can be extended in many ways, by adding some obstacle avoidance, common goal and other effects. Something I find really cool is that we can start each boid at some random initial velocity, and see them slowly come together into a nice flock.

The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/subsid/flocking">here</a>, in case someone wants to play with it. The implementation is based on <a href="https://codepen.io/coaster/pen/QpqVjP">this one by Ellie</a>.
