Inspired by [Nishant](https://nishanttotla.com/blog/2017-year-in-review/) and [Christian Gencos](https://christian.gen.co/2017-review) year in review, I've decided to write one myself. This is just for me to look back and reflect. I usually keep this kind of stuff under the confines of my [emacs org-mode](https://orgmode.org/), but decided to put it out this time. This post is meant to be awfully self-serving :)

In no particular order, here are some of the highlights things that happened in 2018:

* 2018 was my first whole year living by myself. That means making my bed, cooking, doing dishes, cleaning the house, paying bills for a whole year! Though I've done all of that sporadically for most of my life, doing it out of necessity took some getting used to. But now I don't think I'd want it any other way! There is something satisfying about it :) I got into Meal prepping which saved me time and money (and health?). Ofcourse, this didn't stop me from eating out, it just helped me stick to a routine when needed.

* I started playing Table Tennis again (after high school), and went for a couple of tournaments with Gabriele. Finished runner-up in Houston's HITTA summer open.

## Learning

* I took a couple of interesting courses at A&M. [Software Analysis](https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/course/689_spring2018/) was an excellent overview of modern code analysis techniques, for improving code quality, catching bugs, detecting data races and so on. I used these ideas to build a [dynamic taint analysis tool](https://github.com/subsid/dtaint-js) using babel for javascript.

* [Dr. Bettati's](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/bettati/) Operating Systems course was another one that I loved. We built an OS from scratch and ran it on the [Bochs emulator](http://bochs.sourceforge.net/).

* Apart from school, I participated in [EarthX's hackathon] in Dallas. My friend [Shubham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham7jain/) and I pulled an all nighter, with lots of coffee and had a wonderful time [there](https://earthxhack18.devpost.com). We ended up winning StateFarm's challenge (And got IPads!).

* I spent my summer in Austin, working with (RetailMeNot's)[https://www.retailmenot.com/] SRE team. It was an amazing experience. They let me spend a bunch of money to learn kubernetes, terraform, docker, istio, vault and other infra tools! Met some really smart, kind and amazing people there. Loved it!

* In the fall semester, I started doing research work with [Dr. Ioerger](http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/) on Bioinformatics, which was pretty new to me. Improved my statistics knowledge, by implementing statistical methods in [TRANSIT](https://github.com/mad-lab/transit) and analyzing various datasets.

## Travel

* 2018 turned out to be a great year for travel. I travelled around Texas a fair, to Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. My 3 month internship in Austin, allowed me to explore the city and its surroundings. Though I haven't been to many places in the US yet, its probably my favorite city so far.

* I went to Miami and Orland over the Thanksgiving break with Duc Hoang. The lifestyle in Miami seemed really laid back. I was surprised to find some people here, who did not speak any English and run shops. Universal studios and South beach were a great place to relax. Its funny how easy they've made it, to spend money

* New York City was exactly how I imagined US to be when I was a kid. Busy streets, packed roads, everyone hustling! But the food by far takes it! The sheer variety of things I got to try was awesome!

* Towards the end of the year, my friends and I did a trip to San Antonio. It was beautiful!

Overall, I felt pretty good about 2018. Did a lot more than I thought. My main goal for 2018 was to embrace change and venture out. Looking forward to 2019!
