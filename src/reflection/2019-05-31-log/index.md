# Learning and Stuff
* India trip went great! Met family and all my school buddies at roti's wedding
* Came back on the 15th. Moved to Hari's house, good old 704 for the summer. Took a while to clean and setup the place.
* Only other thing I did was finish up slides for my defense.
* Did some thesis writing, but not much.

# Books
* No progress here. Still haven't finished [How not to be wrong](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693884-how-not-to-be-wrong). 
  While most ideas are interesting, I find the book to be a bit dry and slow.

P.S: Posting on June 6th. Not the most exciting May, after India trip that is.
