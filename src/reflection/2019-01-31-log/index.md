# Learning

* Spent a bunch of time learning entropy, thanks to Prof. Andrew Jiang's seminar.

* Started writing paper summaries. I realized that its really hard for me to read a paper to completion. I mostly end up stopping early. Making myself post it here, so that I finish reading papers.

* Dr. Bettati's OS course in RUST is fun, looking forward to start working on that.

* [Michael Jordan's medium post on AI](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7) was brilliant. Put things into perspective for me, in terms of technology.

* Started using Screen more regularly, as I had to run jobs in TRANSIT. [This is a nice cheat-sheet](https://www.darkcoding.net/strategy/gnu-screen-basics-quick-reference/).

# Books

* Finished [12 rules of life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30257963-12-rules-for-life).
* Started reading [Fabric of the cosmos again](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22435.The_Fabric_of_the_Cosmos) again.
