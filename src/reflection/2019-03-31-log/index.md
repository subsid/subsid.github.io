# Learning and Stuff
* [Law of time and chaos kurzweil](https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/messerly20160204)
This is Kurzweil's argument for "The law of accelerating returns".
When the order of a system is low (Or Entropy is high), the time between salient events is large. (Like cosmic evolution, biological development). But when the chaos decreases and order increases, time between salient events reduce as well. Thus, even though the universe increases in Entropy, evolution leads to increasing pockets of order and complex systems.
* Wanted a break. Went to Austin, chilled with Venky and John.
* Nice Illustration CrashCourse. [Crashcourse Human chromosomes vs dna vs genes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ojaHrxQR0)

This allows us to compare sequences from different libraries.
