# Learning

* Started learning RUST for OS course. Really cool language. Their [documentation and book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) is great!

* [Paper summary](https://subsid.github.io/blog/continuous-reasoning/) for Peter O'Hearn's continuous reasoning. Really nice to see Static analysis being used in practice.

* [Carrie Ann's computers crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZGugFqdr60&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&index=8) is just too much fun. I see myself coming back to this once in a while.

* Working of clocks using [Piezoelectricity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Piezoelectricity) is dope! Mechanical to Electrical, Electrical to Mechanical materials. [TED ed video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEJ2qryXcIQ)

* [TRANSIT](https://github.com/mad-lab/transit) contribution. GFF to Prot-table converter. Working on more exciting changes next month!

# Books

* Read cosmology part of [Fabric of the cosmos](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22435.The_Fabric_of_the_Cosmos) again. Brian Greene's explanations of complex theories are just fascinating.

* Finished [Spontaneous Evolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3026782-spontaneous-evolution). This was an interesting take of evolution and genetics (and [epigenetics](https://www.whatisepigenetics.com/epigenetics-avoiding-the-pull-of-pseudoscientific-nonsense/)). Not sure how much of it is backed by other researchers. Part of the authors argument is everything cannot be answered by science. He quotes Quantum field theory and cosmology as an example for spooky/spiritual explanation. I found his take on evolution of human belief systems pretty interesting. **Animism** - Everything has a spirit, **Polytheism** - Existence of many gods, hierarchy of Gods, explanation for why some forces are more powerful than others etc. **Monotheism** - One God to rule them all! **Scientific Materialism** - Matter is the essence of the universe. (More of a Newtonian perspective, not the "spooky" quantum perspective). Science + Belief/Spirit is the way to go.
