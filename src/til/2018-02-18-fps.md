FPS refers to number of images streamed or captured per second.
Normally, in tv/recorders, we see 24-30 fps.

Usual misconception is apparently human eye cannot recognize beyond 30 fps.

## When to use what?

Well, if we are just going to do some cctv recording, its enough if we do 1fps as
all we need to do is recognize if someone is passing by or whatever. The video will be choppy,
but that's fine.

So its usually a good idea to set fps based on what the valuable information is.

For films, 24-30 was the norm, but movies like avatar and hobbit figured 48/60 fps is
the sweet spot for smooth animations.

## Resolution
How many $horizontal * vertical$ numbers are displayed? i.e. how many pixels.
Higher the resolution, more the gpu power we need. This is because we need to calculate more pixels values.
