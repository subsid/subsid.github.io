Hi! My name is Siddharth Subramaniyam. Currently, I'm a CS Masters student at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>, College Station. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and building large scale systems. My interests broadly fall into distributed systems, information retrieval, and HCI.

At A&M, I work on building gaze interaction systems for VR at the <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/hammond/people.php">Sketch Recognition lab </a>.
Recently, I've been really fascinated and excited by Bioinformatics. With fast and cheap DNA sequencing, we've slowly been able to understand the incredible diversity of bacteria. At the <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/">Ioerger lab</a>, I help build computational tools (like <a href="https://github.com/mad-lab/transit">TRANSIT</a>) for statistical analysis of this data in order to learn more about these incredible beings.

In the past, I've worked at <a href="https://retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a> and <a href="https://govimana.com/">VIMANA</a> as a software engineer.
Other things I enjoy include table tennis, soccer, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42079095-siddharth-subramaniyam), cooking, biking, hiking and fitness.
