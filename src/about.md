Hi! My name is Siddharth Subramaniyam. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com).  I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and building large scale systems. My interests broadly fall into Distributed Systems, Information Retrieval, and HCI.

In Grad school, I got really fascinated and excited by Bioinformatics. With fast and cheap DNA sequencing, we've slowly been able to understand the incredible diversity of bacteria. At the <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/">Ioerger lab</a>, I helped build computational tools (like <a href="https://github.com/mad-lab/transit">TRANSIT</a>) for statistical analysis of this data in order to learn more about these incredible beings.

In the past, I've worked at <a href="https://retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a> and <a href="https://govimana.com/">VIMANA</a> as a software engineer.
Other things I enjoy include table tennis, soccer, [books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42079095-siddharth-subramaniyam), cooking, biking, hiking and fitness.
