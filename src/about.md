Hi! My name is Siddharth Subramaniyam. Currently, I'm a CS Masters student at <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>, College Station, where I work on Bioinformatics in <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/">Ioerger lab</a> and Sketch Recognition in <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/hammond/people.php">SRL</a>. I am interested in interdisciplinary research and building large scale systems.

In the past, I've worked at <a href="https://retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a> and <a href="https://govimana.com/">VIMANA</a>.
Other things I enjoy include building stuff, table tennis, soccer, cooking, biking, hiking and fitness.

Recently, I've started keeping track of the [books I read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42079095-siddharth-subramaniyam).
