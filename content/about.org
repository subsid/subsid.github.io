Hi! My name is Siddharth Subramaniyam. Currently focused on building Neural Models at Etsy. My interests broadly fall into Information Retrieval, Distributed Systems, Machine Learning, and Bioinformatics.
In the past I've worked as a full-stack engineer, SRE, and ML researcher.

In Grad school, I was really fascinated by Bioinformatics. With fast and cheap DNA sequencing, we've slowly been able to understand the incredible diversity of bacteria. At the [[http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/][Ioerger Lab]], I helped build computational tools (like [[https://github.com/mad-lab/transit][Transit]]) for statistical analysis of this data in order to learn more about these incredible beings.

If any of these interest you, say hi! [[https://twitter.com/_subsid][Twitter]] | [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/subsid/][LinkedIn]]
