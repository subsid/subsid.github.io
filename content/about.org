Hi! My name is Siddharth Subramaniyam. Currently, I'm a Software Engineer at [[https://www.etsy.com][Etsy]]. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and building large scale systems. My interests broadly fall into Distributed Systems, Information Retrieval, and HCI.

In Grad school, I was really fascinated by Bioinformatics. With fast and cheap DNA sequencing, we've slowly been able to understand the incredible diversity of bacteria. At the [[http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/][Ioerger Lab]], I helped build computational tools (like [[https://github.com/mad-lab/transit][Transit]]) for statistical analysis of this data in order to learn more about these incredible beings.

In the past, I've worked at [[https://retailmenot.com/][RetailMeNot]] and [[https://govimana.com/][Vimana]] as a software engineer.
