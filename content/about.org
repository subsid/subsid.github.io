I'm Siddharth (Sid) Subramaniyam. I enjoy working in interdisciplinary fields and building large-scale systems.

Currently, I'm working on ML models for [[https://www.meta.com/blog/surface-emg-wristband-electromyography-human-computer-interaction-hci/][neural interfaces]] at Meta, establishing new HCI interfaces. Before that, I built [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04833][retrieval models]] at Etsy to help people discover products they'd love through better search. I've also worked as a full-stack engineer, SRE, and ML researcher.

What really excites me is solving problems in interdisciplinary fields, where I get to learn from different experts: whether its training ML models, designing large-scale systems, analyzing genomic data. In grad school, I was fascinated by how cheap DNA sequencing was revealing the incredible variety of bacterial life around us. At the [[https://tbsgc.org/?page_id=1246][Ioerger Lab]], I built computational tools (like [[https://github.com/mad-lab/transit][Transit]] / [[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6873424/][ZINB]])  for statistical analysis of this data in order to learn more about these incredible beings.
