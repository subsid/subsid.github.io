<h1 class="title">Sketch Tutor - Game based learning</h1>
<p>
Sketch recognition is the automated recognition of hand drawn diagrams. In general, sketch recognition techniques can be classified into three types:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b><b>Appearance based</b></b> This comes more from the field of computer vision, but is not very useful for varying shapes. It does not take temporal data into account.</li>

<li><b><b>Gesture based</b></b> Most useful for forensic methods, but requires user specific training. Every individual has their own quirks when sketching!</li>

<li><b><b>Geometric based</b></b> Models are built based on Geometric constraints. Requires neater sketches, but very flexible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The field is quite fascinating, and methods here can be extended into areas of activity recognition and eye tracking. <a href="http://srl.tamu.edu">Dr. Hammond's SRL Lab</a> has some interesting research in the area.
</p>

<p>
<b>Sketch Tutor</b> is a sketch based game for learning new symbols. Similar to the old game typing-tutor, the idea is to gamify learning a new language, numerals or set of symbos in general. The prototype version of the game supports learning 1-10 numbers in chinese. The scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and number of attempts.
</p>

<p>
The generalized recognition algorithm is based on the <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/icmi-12.pdf">$P algorithm</a>. While the current version of the game supports chinese characters from 1-10, the system can be easily extended to have a training phase, where the generalized learning algorithm can be trained on a new set of symbol.
