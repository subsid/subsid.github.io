    2018 Review
  </h1>
  <div class="ui divider"></div>
  <div>
    <p>Inspired by <a href="https://nishanttotla.com/blog/2017-year-in-review/">Nishant</a> and <a href="https://christian.gen.co/2017-review">Christian Gencos</a> year in review, I've decided to write one myself. This is just for me to look back and reflect. I usually keep this kind of stuff under the confines of my <a href="https://orgmode.org/">emacs org-mode</a> but decided to put it out this time. This post is meant to be awfully self-serving :)</p>
<p>In no particular order, here are some of the highlights of 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2018 was my first whole year living by myself. That means making my bed, cooking, doing dishes, cleaning the house, paying bills for a whole year! Though I've done all of that sporadically for most of my life, doing it out of necessity took some getting used to. But now I don't think I'd want it any other way! There is something satisfying about it :) I got into Meal prepping which saved me time and money (and health?). Of course, this didn't stop me from eating out, it just helped me stick to a routine when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I started playing Table Tennis again (after high school) and went for a couple of tournaments with Gabriele. Finished runner-up in Houston's HITTA summer open.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I took a couple of interesting courses at A&amp;M. <a href="https://parasol.tamu.edu/~jeff/course/689_spring2018/">Software Analysis</a> was an excellent overview of modern code analysis techniques, for improving code quality, catching bugs, detecting data races and so on. I used these ideas to build a <a href="https://github.com/subsid/dtaint-js">dynamic taint analysis tool</a> using Babel for javascript.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/bettati/">Dr. Bettati's</a> Operating Systems course was another one that I loved. We built an OS from scratch and ran it on the <a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs emulator</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apart from school, I participated in [EarthX's hackathon] in Dallas. My friend <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham7jain/">Shubham</a> and I pulled an all-nighter, with lots of coffee and had a wonderful time <a href="https://earthxhack18.devpost.com">there</a>. We ended up winning StateFarm's challenge (And got IPads!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I spent my summer in Austin, working with <a href="https://www.retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot's</a> SRE team. It was an amazing experience. They let me spend a bunch of money to learn kubernetes, terraform, docker, istio, vault, and other infra tools! Met some really smart, kind and amazing people there. Loved it!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the fall semester, I started doing research work with <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/ioerger/">Dr. Ioerger</a> on Bioinformatics, which was pretty new to me. Improved my statistics knowledge, by implementing statistical methods in <a href="https://github.com/mad-lab/transit">TRANSIT</a> and analyzing various datasets.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>2018 turned out to be a great year for travel. I traveled around Texas a fair bit - Houston, Dallas, San Antonio. My 3-month internship in Austin, allowed me to explore the city and its surroundings. Though I haven't been to many places in the US yet, it's probably my favorite city so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I went to Miami and Orland over the Thanksgiving break with my friend Duc. The lifestyle in Miami seemed really laid back. I was surprised to find some people here, who did not speak any English and run shops. Universal studios and South beach were a great place to relax. It is quite impressive on how easy they've made it, to spend money</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New York City was exactly how I imagined US to be when I was a kid. Busy streets, packed roads, everyone hustling! But the food by far takes it! The sheer variety of things I got to try was awesome!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Towards the end of the year, my friends and I did a trip to San Antonio. It was beautiful!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I felt pretty good about 2018. Did a lot more than I thought. My main goal for 2018 was to embrace change and venture out. Looking forward to 2019!</p>
