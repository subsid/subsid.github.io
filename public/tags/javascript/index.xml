      <description>Sketch recognition is the automated recognition of hand drawn diagrams. In general, sketch recognition techniques can be classified into three types:
Appearance based This comes more from the field of computer vision, but is not very useful for varying shapes. It does not take temporal data into account.
Gesture based Most useful for forensic methods, but requires user specific training. Every individual has their own quirks when sketching! Geometric based Models are built based on Geometric constraints.</description>

      <description>Blog Programming Languages Java Script As a part my of physics based modelling course, I implemented a flocking simulation using threejs.
Flocking (or Swarming) is a nice example of something known as emergent behavior (wiki).
Emergence is a phenomenon whereby larger entities arise through interactions among smaller or simpler entities such that the larger entities exhibit properties the smaller/simpler entities do not exhibit.
This behavior is common among various animal groups such as birds, ants, bees, fishes.</description>
